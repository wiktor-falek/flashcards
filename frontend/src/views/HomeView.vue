      <h1>Why use flashcards?</h1>
      <p>
        Flashcards, when used correctly, are a proven method of engaging in
        active recall, which helps you retain your study material for longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this app is to simplify the process of
        <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"
          >spaced repetition</a
        >.

      <h1>How it works</h1>

      <p>
        After learning a concept create a flashcard with a question at the front
        and an answer at the back, you also have an option to include a code
        snippet.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a flashcard shows up during your learning session, try to answer
        the question. Check if it matches the answer. Ideally you should aim to
        repeat this process at least three times.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you feel confident about the topic, mark the flashcard as memorized.
        It won't be presented to you anymore, but it still will be available in
        Completed Collection.
